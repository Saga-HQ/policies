You can use the Service on a free plan basis, which has a limit to the number of Spaces that can be created.
Spaces included in a free plan have a limit to the number of users that can access and edit them. There is no other limitation on functionality for Spaces on the free plan.
You can upgrade any Space to a paid plan, and this will allow an unlimited number of users to access and edit it. The paid plan is only available on a paid-for subscription basis, which can be either monthly or yearly (see Billing, Section 8).
We may from time to time offer a Free Trial of the unlimited plan for a limited period. We may do so at our discretion, and we may, at any time, and without giving notice, modify the terms and conditions that apply to this Free Trial, or cancel it.

## 7. Referrals and Credit

> TL;DR: You may accrue Credits to offset your Subscription fees through our Referral Program. Share your unique Referral Link with a new user, and on signup both you and the new user with receive Credits. Credits are non-transferable, and may be revoked if we believe there is an infringement of these Terms. There is a maximum limit of $200.00.

Your account with the Service can accrue credits in a variety of ways ("Account Credits") for example by referring new users to Saga ("Referral Program"). Account Credits can only be used to offset your Service's Subscription fees.
You can earn Account Credits by inviting new users to Saga.
You will be assigned a personal referral link for referring new users that can be redeemed online inside the Service. When a new user signs up and opens a Service account via your personal Referral Link, both you and the new user will receive Account Credits.
To qualify for Account Credits via the Referral Program, the referred new user must be a new user who has not previously created an account on the Service, and with an valid referral link.
You and your referred new user will receive the Account Credits amount specified on our Pricing page at the time of the referral. The Account Credits will be credited to your respective Service accounts after your referred new user signs up and opens a Service account via your Personal Referral Link. The maximum total of Account Credits you may receive under the Referral Program is $200.00 (“Account Credit Limit”). Once the Account Credit Limit has been reached, you will no longer receive any Account Credits for referrals.
For Account Credits to apply, you must have a paid Subscription or first upgrade to a paid Subscription. If you already have a paid Subscription, you may apply Account Credits to the next payment due in your Billing Cycle. If you are upgrading to a paid Subscription, Account Credits may be applied to your new paid Subscription.

Users may not collect Account Credits available under the Referral Program by:
- self-referring by using multiple or false names, identities, accounts or email addresses;
- referring anyone who is an existing Saga user, including an existing user with an account under an alternate email address;
- using spam or sending unsolicited emails to persons they don’t personally know to collect referrals, or otherwise violating any applicable law, rule, regulation or third party terms of use;
- posting on message boards, public forums, coupon sites or other online venues;
- permitting another individual to use the referring user’s account;
- referring fake people to the Service, impersonating another person, or otherwise providing Saga with false or misleading information;
- using the personal Referral Link in any manner that is disparaging or that otherwise portrays Saga in a negative light.
- any other restriction we impose on participants in our Referral Program in our discretion upon prior notice.

By acquiring Account Credits, you agree and acknowledge that we are granting you a limited, revocable license to a digital item, and that the Account Credits are not your personal property. Except as explicitly provided herein, your personal Referral Link and Account Credits are non-transferable. Account Credits cannot be applied to previous purchases, and are not redeemable for cash. All Account Credits are voided immediately upon termination of our Referral Program. We reserve the right to suspend or cancel accounts or remove Account Credits in our sole discretion if we notice any activity that we believe is abusive or fraudulent.

## 8. Billing, Fees and Fee Changes

> TL;DR: We charge subscription fees on a monthly or yearly basis. You may cancel your Subscription at any time in the dedicated section of our Service, or by emailing us at support@saga.so. We might change prices at any time, but we will notify you in time.

When on a paid Subscription, you will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle").
Billing Cycles are set on a monthly or yearly basis.
A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Saga with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Saga to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
For details of how we use the information you supply in connection with payment, please see our Privacy Policy.
Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, we may attempt to charge the credit card on file one or more times. Should payment continue to fail beyond one (1) week since the end of the previous Billing Cycle, the Subscription may be terminated.
You may cancel your Subscription either through your online account management page of the Service or by contacting our customer support team at support@saga.so.
We may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions at any time. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the Billing Cycle current at the time.
We will give you a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
If you continue to use the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect, you will be charged according to the modified Subscription fee amount.
Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, “Taxes”). You will be responsible for paying all Taxes associated with your Subscription, except for those taxes based on our net income. Should any payment for the Service be subject to withholding tax by any government, you will reimburse us for such withholding tax.

## 9. Refunds

> TL;DR: Processed payments are non-refundable and there are no credits for unused Subscription periods. You may continue to use the Subscription until the end of the current Billing Cycle.

When you register for the Service, we will ask you to confirm your acceptance of these Terms and to pay any Charges that apply. However, no contract exists between you and us for the supply of the Service until we send you confirmation to the email address you have given, and (where you have subscribed for a Subscription paid plan), we have received the Charges that apply.
Payment obligations are non-cancelable, and fees paid are non-refundable and there are no credits for partially used Subscription periods.
Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of Saga.
We believe in a fair refund policy, therefore we will keep your Subscription active until the end of the current Billing Cycle, after which you will be downgraded to a free plan.
